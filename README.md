### About this project

**Data Cooker ETL** is a batch/interactive ETL processor that provides simple yet powerful [SQL-like language](https://pastorgl.github.io/datacooker-etl/TDL.html) to perform transformations of columnar and/or structured data, which doesn't require strict schema nor data catalog. Built on Apache Spark core with minimal dependencies.
 
Historically it was used in a GIS project, so it has geospatial extensions to its SQL, and has been extensively tested and proven reliable by years and petabytes of transformed data in production.
