### About this project

**Data Cooker ETL** is an ETL framework that provides simple yet powerful [SQL-like language](https://pastorgl.github.io/datacooker-etl/TDL4.html) to perform dataset transformations. It is built on Apache Spark, but doesn't require strict schema nor data catalog.
 
Historically it was used in a GIS project, so it has geospatial extensions to SQL, and has been extensively tested and proven reliable by years in production.
