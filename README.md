**Data Cooker** is an ETL framework that provides simple yet powerful SQL-like language to perform dataset transformations. It is built on Apache Spark, but doesn't require strict schema nor data catalog.
 
Historically it was used in a GIS project, so it has geospatial extensions to SQL, and is well tested and proved by years in production.
